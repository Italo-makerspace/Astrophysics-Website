            <h2>Fundamentals of Astrophysics</h2>
            <p>
            Introductory astrophysics provides the foundation for understanding how celestial phenomena are explained by the fundamental laws of physics. At this stage, essential concepts such as gravitation, radiation, and orbital dynamics are emphasized.

            <h3>Universal Gravitation</h3>
            <p>
            Gravity is the fundamental interaction responsible for the formation of planetary systems, the structure of galaxies, and the large-scale dynamics of the universe. Newton described the attraction between masses as a force proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Later, Einstein redefined this perspective by proposing that gravity is the curvature of space-time caused by mass-energy.

            <h3>Electromagnetic Radiation</h3>
            <p>
            Most of the information about the universe reaches us through electromagnetic radiation: visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and other frequencies. The electromagnetic spectrum is therefore the primary source of observational data in astrophysics, allowing scientists to analyze the temperature, chemical composition, and motion of stars and galaxies.

            <h3>Orbital Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
            The motion of celestial bodies follows Kepler's laws, derived from gravitational interactions. Planets describe elliptical orbits around their stars, and orbital velocity depends on the mass of the central body and its distance from it. These principles explain everything from the operation of artificial satellites to the movement of exoplanets in distant systems.
