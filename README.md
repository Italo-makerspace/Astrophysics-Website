Astrophysics Visualizations
===========================

Overview
--------

This project is an interactive educational platform designed to visualize fundamental and advanced concepts of astrophysics. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers dynamic simulations that help users intuitively understand complex phenomena such as spacetime distortion, orbital mechanics, gravitational lensing, black holes, universe expansion, and gravitational waves. The platform aims to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and visual comprehension, providing an engaging and informative experience.

Features
--------

-   **Spacetime Distortion:** Interactive grid simulating how a massive object bends spacetime, allowing users to move the mass and observe the resulting curvature in real time.

-   **Orbital Mechanics:** Simulates a planetary orbit around a central star, demonstrating the effects of gravity and circular motion.

-   **Black Hole Simulation:** Visualizes gravitational attraction and light bending near a black hole, including the concept of the event horizon.

-   **Universe Expansion:** Animated galaxies illustrate cosmic expansion and the concept of radial motion of galaxies away from a central point.

-   **Light Time Dilation:** Demonstrates gravitational lensing and the relativistic effects of time dilation near massive objects.

-   **Magnetic Waves:** RGB wave simulation to represent electromagnetic phenomena and the propagation of waves in space.

Technologies
------------

-   **HTML5 & CSS3:** Semantic structuring, responsive design, and styling.

-   **JavaScript (Canvas API):** Real-time animations, physics simulations, and interactive visualizations.

-   **Google Fonts & Font Awesome:** Typography and iconography for enhanced visual presentation.

Purpose
-------

The platform serves as a learning tool for students, educators, and enthusiasts, translating abstract astrophysical principles into accessible visual models. By directly manipulating objects and observing dynamic effects, users develop a more intuitive understanding of how the universe behaves under different physical conditions.
