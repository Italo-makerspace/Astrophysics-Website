        <h2 class="center-text">A Gateway to the Cosmos</h2>

        <p>
          Astrophysics is more than a field of knowledge: it is a gateway to understanding both the universe itself and, at the same time, our own nature. It goes beyond the simple observation of the night sky, seeking to uncover the mechanisms that drive the birth of stars, the dance of planets, the life of galaxies, and even the boundaries of space-time. Along the way, it unites human curiosity with scientific precision, turning age-old questions into investigations capable of revealing the vastness and complexity of the cosmos.
        </p>

        <p>
          The journey begins with the fundamentals of physics applied to the celestial realm, but it quickly expands to scales that challenge the limits of imagination. In explaining starlight, the energy of the Sun, or the motion of galaxies, astrophysics does more than describe phenomena: it reveals profound connections between universal laws and what we witness when we lift our eyes to the sky. This interplay between theory and observation opens the path to advanced concepts, where relativity, quantum mechanics, and dark matter converge in the search for answers that remain incomplete.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is precisely in this meeting of the known and the unknown that astrophysics finds its most inspiring dimension. As Carl Sagan once reminded us, <em>“we are made of starstuff”</em>: every atom in our bodies carries the mark of ancient cosmic processes. Recognizing this invites us to reflect on our origins, our place in the universe, and our responsibility toward the rare phenomenon of life on Earth. Thus, astrophysics presents itself not merely as frontier science, but as a continuous journey of discovery—one in which every answer brings us closer to new mysteries, and reminds us of the beauty of existence.
